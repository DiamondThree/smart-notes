2. Inline Copilot: We believe that OpenAI will make an excellent "brainstorming partner" for our users. This feature will allow our customers to continue writing with the support of OpenAI's creative assistance. Together, our users and OpenAI can produce more engaging and robust content.

3. Chat with Copilot: OpenAI's language processing capabilities will allow us to create an intuitive chat system for our users. With this feature, our customers can find the answers they need, without having to navigate away from their writing environment, promoting a seamless and productive user experience.

4. Customer Support Copilot: We are excited to explore how OpenAI can help us streamline our customer support process. By incorporating OpenAI's capabilities, our users can receive the assistance they need to maximize the use of our products.
